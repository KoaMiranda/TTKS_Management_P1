Traveling Salesman Problem For Mr. Keogh's Almond Farm

Summary of the problem, originally created for our primary eliciation document for Mr. Keogh.

You own an almond orchard in California. Your primary source of revenue is selling said almonds. The Navel Orangeworm (NOW) infects almonds and the larvae destroy the crop. This leads to a $2 billion loss on average. To reduce/eliminate this crop damage, the solution you have chosen is utilizing pheromones. The pheromones confuse the male NOWs leaving them unable to find females, which in turn renders the females unable to lay eggs. Specifically the delivery vector you have chosen is a pheromone paste, which can be applied via drone armed with a mastic gun. The drones fly from pre-designated charging platforms and must begin and end their application routes there. You have assured us that each drone can reliably fly up to 6000m before needing to be recharged. You have provided us with several maps that divide your orchard into chunks containing at most 256 and at least 1 application point(s). You have also given us examples of application paths you have tested and the time it took to create them on pen and paper. 

Our job is to create a program that can create application paths that will minimize the distance your drones will have to fly, while still applying pheromone paste at each point in the sector.
